# CKD-Prediction-using-Machine-learning
# 🧪 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Prediction using Machine Learning

This machine learning project predicts the presence of Chronic Kidney Disease based on patient health metrics. Early detection of CKD can lead to timely treatment and better health outcomes. The model classifies whether a patient is at risk of CKD using medical features.

## 📊 Problem Statement

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a serious health condition. This project uses classification algorithms to predict CKD presence using input features like:

- Blood Pressure
- Albumin
- Sugar
- Serum Creatinine
- Hemoglobin
- and more...

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
